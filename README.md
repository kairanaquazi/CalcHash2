# CalcHash
Fork of [Breisfeld's CalcHash](https://github.com/breisfeld/CalcHash) that patches some issues regarding shake 128 and 256.


A plugin for the file manager `fman` that computes the hash of the selected files and copies the results to the clipboard.

Brief instructions: 
- Select a file or files (not a directory or directories)
- Press the assigned key (default is `Shift+F11`) 
- Choose the hashing algorithm

Results will be copied to the clipboard.
